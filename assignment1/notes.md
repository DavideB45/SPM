# STUFF TO REMEMBER IN THE REPORT
## Speedup:
- it's a bit random at the begining because with small number avx is better, than reaches a stable point
- auto: 2.75
- AVX:  3.5

## Plots:
- small vector unstable, just see that avx is lower and stable
- big vector: insert log log scale plot or normal scale plot
